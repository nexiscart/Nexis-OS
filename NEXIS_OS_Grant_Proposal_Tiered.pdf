Overview
Nexis OS is a next-generation, modular AI infrastructure stack engineered to autonomously build,
deploy, and scale intelligent systems across commerce, governance, and digital economies. Powered
by multi-model architecture—including NOVEX (general intelligence), HELIX (agent orchestration), and
SYNQ (financial logic)—Nexis delivers enterprise-grade AI capabilities to underserved regions,
sovereign institutions, and public creators alike.
Use of Grant Funds
Note: While $150K will fully fund the public deployment of Nexis OS, an extended $200K allocation
would enable scaled infrastructure deployment, wider regional access, and accelerated release of all
four OS variants globally.
- $75K – GPU towers, inference servers, and compute infrastructure
- $50K – Production-level deployment of Nexis OS variants:
• Core (Dev Tools)
• Aura (Public Agent)
• Sovereign (Gov)
• Dominion (Global South)
- $40K – Development of core models: NOVEX, SYNQ, LUMIS
- $35K – Founder salary + operational costs for full-time execution
MVP Applications
- HoloFace – Holographic AI assistant
- SynqBuilder – No-code software & app generation via AI
- NexisBoost – Fully autonomous digital product launcher & traffic engine
Impact Potential
- 1M+ users across global developer & public markets
- 100K+ autonomous agents deployed for businesses, creators, and governments
- Economic uplift targeting Africa, LATAM, underserved digital economies
- Enabling AI-powered sovereignty, scalable governance, and digital independence
Closing Statement
This $200K grant will activate a global-first AI OS with far-reaching economic, technological, and
human impact. Nexis is not a product—it’s the infrastructure layer for the next civilization leap
