## Funding Goal
Seeking $200,000 in pre-legal, GPU-focused capital to finalize deployment and launch public infrastructure layers.

## Status
- Built solo over 10 weeks with zero funding
- Frontend deployed: [https://nexisinfra.tech](https://nexisinfra.tech)
- Proposal: [NEXIS_OS_Grant_Proposal_Tiered.pdf](./docs/NEXIS_OS_Grant_Proposal_Tiered.pdf)

> Fully bootstrapped, GPU-blocked. This repo is the open-source core of the next AI civilization layer.
